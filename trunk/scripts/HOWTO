Creating and editing box files.

* Go into a pages/* directory in SVN
* should symbolically link breaks.pl, getdiffs.pl, makefile, token.sh there
* let's say we're on page 004, and we have 004.tif and 004.txt transcription
* open the .tif image for reference
* $ make 004.box  (assumes we have gle-uncial model built and installed already)
* $ vi 004.txt
  Add page header, anything else obviously missing
* $ bash token.sh 004
  This script *does not* affect 004.txt or 004.box.  The net result of it is to 
  generate what it hopes will be an improved/corrected box file which gets the
  name 004.box.2.   It does this by aligning words in 004.box with 004.txt and
  then checking for likely substitutions in the box file, and merging boxes where
  appropriate.   For it to work, the number of words must be identical, so when
  you're initially thrown into vimdiff, go through and add/delete <w> markers
  so that the number of words is the same.   Don't bother making any other
  corrections manually at this stage.  Only exceptions: if chars were dropped from
  the OCR output (LHS), as sometimes happens, it's ok to remove them from the 
  RHS and this may improve the results (again, won't affect the transcription).
  And if there's dark blue on the RHS, these may be extra inserted characters
  and should be corrected by hand.
* $ diff -u 004.box 004.box.2
  If all the corrections look legitimate, mv 004.box.2 to 004.box.   Sometimes
  only a subset of this diff is OK, and you can copy that to a patch and apply
  just that patch.  
     Next, in two other windows, open 004.box and 004.txt.
* $ bash token.sh 004
  Go through vimdiff and use the info there to manually finish corrected 004.box
  (and occasionally correcting things in 004.txt as well).  When done:
* $ bash token.sh 004
  The only remaining differences should be ligatures and occasional differences
  in word breaks <w> (from words jammed together or spread out too much, e.g. 
  after "d'")
* $ svn commit -m "Transcription corrected based on OCR output"  004.txt
* $ svn add 004.box
* $ svn commit -m "Manually corrected box file" 004.box
